# Introduction

Movies theatre are a frequent destination for family and friends gathering, enjoying a visual adventure and escape from the world several hours with some minimal costs. However, there are thousands and thousands of movies being produced across the globe each year, what are the decisive factors of which movies the audience would choose? Many previous studies have attempted to explore the determinant of movie box office and tried to use these to predict box office of movies at various stage. We would implement a similar approach, but trying to test, whether some minimal information would be enough for us to determine explain the box office of movies. \\

To do so, we fit a linear regression model using Genre, Distributor, MPAA, Release Dates and whether the title of the movie includes some frequent word to predict number of tickets sold for a movie. And we will try to fit a predicitve neural network based on findings from linear regression model, and see whether we can product accurate results. This would determine whether movie's box office relies only on these simple information. \\

We find that using simple information like these does not fully explain movie's box office, as our linear regresison model, after tuning only shows an $R^2$ of 0.35. This also leads to poor performance of our predictive model. From this we discover that these simple parameters are not enough to determine a movie's box office. Among these predictors though, Genre is the most impactful towards the number of tickets sold, demonstrating that audience tend to prefer a certain genre of movies when they are picking which one to watch. 


Although the results from our analysis are not as useful, we provide future studies with understanding that whether a movie sells well depends on various factors and cannot be explained in simple terms. This could benefit future investors who plan to invest in movies about obtaining more data on the movie before making their decisions and future studies in incorporating other factors. 

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: We will first provide an overview of our data and the necessary cleaning procedures. Followed by our analysis and results. We will then discuss results and limitaiton, providing future directions in similar studies. 






# Data {#sec-data}

## Overview

We use the statistical programming language R [@citeR].... Our data [@shelter].... Following @tellingstories, we consider...

Overview text

## Measurement
	
Some paragraphs about how we go from a phenomena in the world to an entry in the dataset.

## Outcome variables

Add graphs, tables and text. Use sub-sub-headings for each outcome variable or update the subheading to be singular.



Some of our data is of penguins (@fig-bills), from @palmerpenguins.

```{r}
#| label: fig-bills
#| fig-cap: Bills of penguins
#| echo: false

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4"),
                    guide = "none") +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~species, ncol = 1) +
  coord_flip()
```

Talk more about it.

And also planes (@fig-planes). (You can change the height and width, but don't worry about doing that until you have finished every other aspect of the paper - Quarto will try to make it look nice and the defaults usually work well once you have enough text.)

```{r}
#| label: fig-planes
#| fig-cap: Relationship between wing length and width
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

analysis_data <- read_csv(here::here("data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.csv"))

analysis_data |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = width, y = length)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Wing width (mm)",
       y = "Wing length (mm)")
```

Talk way more about it. 

## Predictor variables

Add graphs, tables and text.

Use sub-sub-headings for each outcome variable and feel free to combine a few into one if they go together naturally.








# Model

The goal of our modelling strategy is twofold. Firstly,...

Here we briefly describe the Bayesian analysis model used to investigate... Background details and diagnostics are included in [Appendix -@sec-model-details].

## Model set-up

Define $y_i$ as the number of seconds that the plane remained aloft. Then $\beta_i$ is the wing width and $\gamma_i$ is the wing length, both measured in millimeters.  

\begin{align} 
y_i|\mu_i, \sigma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i &= \alpha + \beta_i + \gamma_i\\
\alpha &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\gamma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\sigma &\sim \mbox{Exponential}(1)
\end{align}

We run the model in R [@citeR] using the `rstanarm` package of @rstanarm. We use the default priors from `rstanarm`.


### Model justification

We expect a positive relationship between the size of the wings and time spent aloft. In particular...

We can use maths by including latex between dollar signs, for instance $\theta$.


# Results

Our results are summarized in @tbl-modelresults.

library(rstanarm)

first_model <-

#| warning: false

modelsummary::modelsummary(
  list(
    "First model" = first_model
  ),
  statistic = "mad",
  fmt = 2
)

# Discussion

## First discussion point {#sec-first-point}

If my paper were 10 pages, then should be be at least 2.5 pages. The discussion is a chance to show off what you know and what you learnt from all this. 

## Second discussion point

Please don't use these as sub-heading labels - change them to be what your point actually is.

## Third discussion point

## Weaknesses and next steps

Weaknesses and next steps should also be included.
